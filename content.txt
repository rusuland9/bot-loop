Hello, I came across your profile and noticed you specialize in Shopify projects — it immediately caught my interest.
I’m a Senior Shopify Developer with over 7 years of experience building and optimizing Shopify stores, custom apps, and headless setups for brands like Soko Glam, Temptu, and Love Faith.
I focus on creating fast, scalable, and conversion-driven Shopify solutions— from Store 2.0 themes and custom apps to headless builds with React and Hydrogen.
If you ever need help improving performance, integrating systems, or launching a new store, I’d be happy to collaborate and bring my experience to your team.

If my skills align with what you’re working on, I’d love to discuss how I can support your next project.
Thank you for your time!
